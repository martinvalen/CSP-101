@section Explanation
{
    The image has been loaded over http on an https-page and we get mixed content-warnings.
    <pre>&lt;img src="<strong>http</strong>://sau.no/sau.jpg"/&gt;</pre>
    
    This can be solved using Content Security Policy and upgrade insecure requests, which automatically attempts to load urls with http over https instead.
