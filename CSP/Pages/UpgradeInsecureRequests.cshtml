@section Explanation
{
    <h4>Upgrade-insecure-requests</h4>
    Makes all attempts to load http into https. Fails to load if https-version doesn't exist.
    
    <h4>Block-all-mixed-content</h4>
    Blocks content loaded over http.
    I had this header initially, but it is not recommended to use both this and upgrade-insecure-requests. Upgrade-insecure-requests runs first, making block-all-mixed-content a no-op.
